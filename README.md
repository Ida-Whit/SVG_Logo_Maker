## SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This is a program for developers to quickly create a simple logo for themselves. Once the program is initialized, it takes 4 inputs; three letter logo, background shape color, text color, and shape. Once all this input is collected, the program then creates a logo for you based on your answers.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
In order to initialize this program, open the integrated terminal from index.js. Then enter in "node index.js". You will then be prompted with four different questions. Once you have answered the questions, the program will generate a file named "logo.svg". If you attempt to enter a logo with more than 3 characters, it will re-prompt you to answer the questions again, as the logo has to be less than 3 characters. You can now open your logo.svg file to view your new logo.
